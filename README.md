# Mount-Blade-Mod-Decompilationer
A Mount&amp;Blade Game mod decompilationer that I wrote to alleviate the anger of having no source code of a favored mod.
I developed this on a Windows computer. So the batch file included is the file to fire the whole program.
It seems that the readme.md file is of specific purpose in Linux OS, only that I have no idea of the specifics.
